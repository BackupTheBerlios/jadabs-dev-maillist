Subject: [Jadabs-dev] Project alive?
Message-ID: <308579740608201143v42efec1fod35a7dfe07673579@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,
just found out about this project. Looks extremely interesting but it
seems this list is abandoned since late 2005. Is there any development
going on, is Jadabs able to run on MIDP2 adn if this is not an active
project, where has the focus for the project shifted, any successor?
