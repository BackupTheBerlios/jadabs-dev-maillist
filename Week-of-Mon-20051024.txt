Hello jadabs-dev-group !

On a dynamic service delivery i have following basic questions,which i could
not answer after surfing through the site...

1. Can a CLDC MIDP 1.0 or MIDP 2.0 based OSGI-Framework download dynmically
a SERVICE, Execute it and then throw it away?
2. Can a CLDC MIDP 1.0 or MIDP 2.0 based OSGI-Framework download dynmically
an SERVICE, persist it in its RMS and then based on user request
invoke/execute it?
